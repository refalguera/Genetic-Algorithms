# Genetic-Algorithms

Implementatio of Genetic Algorithms: 
      - To run the DinoRun Chrome game;
      - To tune the hyperparameters of a CNN: Convolutional Layer Size, Droupout Size, Optimizers and Learning Rate.

The genetic algorithm was created by Lu√≠sa Mendes Heise. The algorithm is available in her medium post:  https://medium.com/turing-talks/turing-talks-8-algoritmos-gen%C3%A9ticos-a791c25bd7ba. I used the algorithm to learn more about the functioning of genetic algorithm.
